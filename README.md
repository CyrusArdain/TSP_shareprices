# TSP_shareprices

(I realize that the website can allow you to do this already)

This script will:
 - use the requests module to submit user defined dates for shareprice history
 - use beautifulsoup module to extract selection
 - output to .csv file


To do...
 - add ability to choose dates
 - (Complete) sort data to be most recent date last
 - (Complete) potentially convert date to be 'MM/DD/YYYY'
